      <p>Some of the benefits of plant-based diets include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>Plant based diets allow for faster muscle recovery times because meat and dairy have inflammatory effects. </p></li>
        <li><p>Plant-based eaters get more antioxidants, which help neutralize free radicals. Free radicals lead to muscle fatigue, reduced athletic performance, and impaired recovery.</p></li>
        <li><p>Plant-based diets are usually lower in fat and higher in fiber which results in reduced body fat. Reduced body fat means that athletes can more efficiently use oxygen during exercise. </p></li>
        <li><p>Plant-based diets are better for cardiovascular health. </p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>These benefits are why many of the worlds greatest athletes have switched to plant based diets:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>NBA Star Kyrie Irving </p></li>
        <li><p>GOAT Endurance Runner Scott Jurek</p></li>
        <li><p>Tennis Champion Venus Williams</p></li>
        <li><p>Molly Cameron - The only trans athlete to compete in the UCI Cyclo-Cross World Cup.</p></li>
        <li><p>Colin Kaepernick - NFL </p></li>
        <li><p>Lewis Hamilton - All Time Greatest Formula One Racers </p></li>
        <li><p>Sarah Stewart - Silvermedalist Paralympics athlete</p></li>
      </ol>
